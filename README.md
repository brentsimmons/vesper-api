# vesper-api
This was the API server for Vesper, an iOS note-taking app from Q Branch.

This is not a living project. It’s a historical artifact: it’s the website that ran Vesper’s syncing service, which was taken down when Vesper syncing was turned off.

This code ran on Azure Mobile Services, which has been superseded by Azure App Service. Mobile Services was Node.js plus a bunch of extra features — which means you can’t just take this code and run it without adding the things Mobile Services provided. However, the code is still understandable. You can figure out what it was doing.

The repository includes some things that were generated by the system. For instance, all the READMEs except this one were generated by Mobile Services. I left all of that intact in the interest of historical accuracy — this folder is exactly as pulled from the server, with no changes (except the addition of this README and the LICENSE file).
